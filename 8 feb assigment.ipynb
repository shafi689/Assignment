    "The `abc` module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It provides infrastructure for defining \n",
    "abstract base classes (ABCs) in Python. ABCs are classes that cannot be instantiated directly, but they\n",
    "serve as a blueprint for other classes to inherit from.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `abc` module is used to create abstract classes and interfaces in Python. An abstract class is a class \n",
    "that contains one or more abstract methods, which are methods without an implementation. The responsibility \n",
    "of implementing these abstract methods lies with the derived classes that inherit from the abstract class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `abc` module provides the `ABC` class, which is used as a metaclass for defining abstract base classes. \n",
    "By subclassing the `ABC` class, a class becomes an abstract base class. The `abstractmethod` decorator is \n",
    "used to define abstract methods within the abstract base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few reasons why the `abc` module is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defining common interfaces**: Abstract base classes allow you to define common interfaces or contracts \n",
    "that derived classes must adhere to. This helps in enforcing a consistent structure and behavior among \n",
    "different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enforcing implementation requirements**: Abstract methods in an abstract base class define a set of m\n",
    "ethods that must be implemented by the derived classes. If a derived class fails to implement any of the \n",
    "abstract methods, it will raise an error during instantiation, ensuring that the derived class meets the \n",
    "expected interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Providing a template for subclasses**: Abstract base classes can provide a template or skeleton \n",
    "implementation for some methods while leaving other methods to be implemented by the derived classes. \n",
    "This can help in reducing code duplication and providing default behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Type checking and documentation**: Abstract base classes can be used for type checking and documentation \n",
    "purposes. By using ABCs, you can specify that a variable or function parameter should accept instances of a \n",
    "specific abstract class or its subclasses. This helps in providing clear expectations and better documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `abc` module is a powerful tool for implementing abstraction and providing structure in object-oriented \n",
    "programming. It allows you to define common interfaces, enforce implementation requirements, and create a \n",
    "hierarchy of classes that share common characteristics."

    "Access Modifiers: Access modifiers such as public, protected, and private can be used to control the \n",
    "visibility and accessibility of data members and methods within a class. In Python, the convention is \n",
    "to use underscore prefixes to indicate the intended level of visibility. A single underscore _ denotes a \n",
    "protected member, while a double underscore __ denotes a private member.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getter and Setter Methods: By providing getter and setter methods, you can control how data is accessed and \n",
    "modified from outside the class. Getter methods allow the external code to retrieve the value of a private or \n",
    "protected data member, while setter methods provide a controlled way to modify the data. This helps in a\n",

    "\n",

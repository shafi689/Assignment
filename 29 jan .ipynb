    "where you break down the program into a series of procedures or functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Python has robust support for object-oriented programming, \n",

    "lambda functions, map, reduce, and filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Imperative Programming: Python is an imperative programming language, which means you can write \n",

    "\n",
    "5. Event-Driven Programming: Python can be used for event-driven programming, where actions are \n",

    "programming capabilities.\n",
    "\n",

    "Python's flexibility in supporting multiple programming paradigms makes it suitable for a wide range of \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Download Python: \n",
    "   - Visit the official Python website at https://www.python.org/.\n",
    "   - Click on the \"Downloads\" menu and select the latest stable version of Python for Windows.\n",
    "   - Choose the appropriate installer based on your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). If \n",
    "       you're unsure, select the 64-bit installer.\n",
    "   - Click on the installer to start the download.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run the installer:\n",
    "   - Locate the downloaded installer and double-click on it.\n",
    "   - Check the box that says \"Add Python to PATH\" during the installation process. This will automatically \n",

    "   - Open the command prompt by pressing Win + R, typing \"cmd\", and pressing Enter.\n",

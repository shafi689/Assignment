    "Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a \n",
    "file? Explain each mode\n",
    "of file opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `open()` function is used to open a file. It is a built-in function that returns a file \n",
    "object, which allows you to perform various operations on the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `open()` function takes two parameters: the filename and the mode. The filename is the name or path of \n",
    "the file you want to open, and the mode specifies the purpose for which you are opening the file. Here are the different modes of opening a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `'r'` (Read Mode): This is the default mode. It opens the file for reading. If the file doesn't exist, it \n",
    "raises a `FileNotFoundError` exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `'w'` (Write Mode): This mode opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, it truncates its \n",
    "contents (i.e., clears the file) before writing. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `'a'` (Append Mode): This mode opens the file for appending. If the file exists, it appends the new data \n",
    "at the end of the file without truncating the existing contents. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `'x'` (Exclusive Creation Mode): This mode opens the file for exclusive creation. It creates a new file and \n",
    "raises a `FileExistsError` if the file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `'b'` (Binary Mode): This mode is used in conjunction with other modes (e.g., `'rb'` or `'wb'`). It opens \n",
    "the file in binary mode, allowing you to read or write binary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `'t'` (Text Mode): This mode is the default and is used in conjunction with other modes (e.g., `'rt'` or `\n",
    "    'wt'`). It opens the file in text mode, allowing you to read or write text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `'+'` (Update Mode): This mode is used in conjunction with other modes (e.g., `'r+'` or `'w+'`). It opens \n",
    "the file for both reading and writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a file in a specific mode, you can pass the mode as the second argument to the `open()` function. \n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Opening a file in different modes\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')   # Read mode\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'w')   # Write mode\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'a')   # Append mode\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'x')   # Exclusive creation mode\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'rb')  # Read mode in binary\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'wt')  # Write mode in text\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r+')  # Read and write mode\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to close the file after you finish working with it by calling the `close()` method on the file \n",
    "object or using a context manager (`with` statement). Closing the file ensures that any buffered data is \n",
    "written to the file and frees up system resources.\n",

    "\n",
    "Resource Management: When a file is opened, the operating system allocates certain resources to handle the \n",

    "\n",
    "Data Integrity: When you write or modify data in a file, it is often stored in a buffer before being written \n",

    "flushed (written) to the file. If you don't close the file, there is a risk of losing data if the program \n",
    "terminates unexpectedly or if the buffer is not automatically flushed.\n",
    "\n",

    "allowing other processes to access the file if needed.\n",
    "\n",

    "In this example, the `read()` method is used to read the entire content of the file \"example.txt\" into the \n",

    "2. `readline()`: The `readline()` method is used to read a single line from a file. It reads from the current\n",
    "position of the file pointer until it encounters a newline character (`'\\n'`) or reaches the end of the\n",
    "file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Open the file in read mode\n",

    "on the file object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `readlines()`: The `readlines()` method is used to read all lines from a file and return them as a list of\n",

    "exception occurs within the block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the advantages of using the `with` statement with `open()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Automatic resource management: When you use the `with` statement, you don't have to explicitly call the \n",
    "`close()` method on the file object. The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed when the \n",
    "block of code is exited, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It helps prevent resource leaks and \n",
    "ensures that the file is closed correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Exception handling: The `with` statement handles exceptions gracefully. If an exception occurs within the \n",
    "block of code, the `with` statement automatically closes the file before propagating the exception further. \n",
    "This helps in maintaining the integrity of the file and prevents data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Readability and clarity: By using the `with` statement, the code becomes more readable and concise. It\n",
    "clearly delineates the scope in which the file object is accessible and emphasizes the fact that the file will\n",
    "be automatically closed. It also eliminates the need for an explicit `try...finally` block to handle file \n",
    "closing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of the `with` statement with `open()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    # Perform operations on the file\n",
    "\n",
    "# File is automatically closed outside the 'with' block\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `open()` function is used within the `with` statement to open the file \"example.txt\" in \n",
    "read mode. The file object is assigned to the `file` variable. Inside the `with` block, you can perform \n",
    "various operations on the file. Once the block is exited, either normally or due to an exception, the file is\n",
    "automatically closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `with` statement with `open()` provides a cleaner and safer approach to working with files in\n",

    "Certainly! In Python, the `write()` and `writelines()` functions are used to write data to a file. \n",

    "# File has been written with the content\n",

    "2. `writelines()`: The `writelines()` function is used to write a sequence of strings to a file. It takes an \n",
